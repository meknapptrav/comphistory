# What it is
The 801 was an experimental processor design that implemented the principles that would later be called RISC.  The project started in 1975
to design a "fast core" CPU with reduced instructions that could handle the load of a telephone switching system in real-time.  Although
the telephone project was cancelled, results from the early tests were so positive that the project was expanded to a general purpose 
computer design

The lessons learned in the 801 project eventually led to the IBM POWER architecture and the RS/6000
