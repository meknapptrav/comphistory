# Canon Cat #

## About ##
The Canon Cat was developed by Jef Raskin.  It was an implementation of the idea he had for less confusing user 
interface for regular people - which he initially started at Apple as the Macintosh before Steve Jobs took over the
project.  Effectively, the "operating system" is an integrated office suite in ROM and the user interface is
based entirely on "leaping" (get the Cat reference?) to wherever you want to go by using search.

## Quick Facts ##
- Released 1987
- Integrated 9" B&W CRT
- Forth machine
- Motorola 68000 @ 5 MHz
- 256 KB RAM
- 3.5" single-sided floppy
- Internal 300/1200 baud modem
- Office apps in ROM is the user interface

## Why I find it interesting ##
It provides a simple, focused word processing interface based upon navigation by search.  It is also a Forth machine, 
and the underlying Forth interpreter can be accessed
