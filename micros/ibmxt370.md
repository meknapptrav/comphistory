# IBM PC XT/370, PC AT/370, and the Micro/370 

## Summary
The success of the IBM System/360 and System/370 meant that there was a considerable library of existing business software that was
designed to run on that platform.  There was considerable interest in the ability to run that software on a microcomputer platform.
There were two seperate projects within IBM to reach this goal.  One resulted in the PC XT/370 and AT/370 and the other was to become the 
Micro/370 microprocessor.

## IBM PC XT/370
The XT/370 was introduced in October 1983.  It was built on a standard PC/XT and used a comination of specialized hardware and new
system software developed by IBM.  It could operate as a standard XT and run PC-DOS locally.  It could also act as an 3270 terminal (similiar
to the 3270 PC).  And finally, and most distinctively, it could execute System/370 code locally.
