# IBM System/360

## What it is
A "family" of computers introduced by IBM in 1964.  Prior to the System/360, IBM made different computers for different market segments
and they were frequently incompatible with one another.

The System/360 line contained different models that could meet the needs and budget of the entire breadth of IBM's customer base.  A
key advantage to the System/360 line was the software developed was "upwardly compatible" with bigger models in the line.  In other
words, if you upgraded to a bigger model, you could bring all your software with you generally unmodified.

The S/360 was immensly popular and dominated the mainframe market.  IBM mainframes to this day are an evolution of the original S/360 and 
could still run software developed for the first models in the late 60s.
