# IBM System/360

## What it is
A "family" of computers introduced by IBM in 1964.  Prior to the System/360, IBM made different computers for different market segments
and they were frequently incompatible with one another.

The System/360 line contained different models that could meet the needs and budget of the entire breadth of IBM's customer base.  A
key advantage to the System/360 line was the software developed was "upwardly compatible" with bigger models in the line.  In other
words, if you upgraded to a bigger model, you could bring all your software with you generally unmodified.

The S/360 was immensly popular and dominated the mainframe market.  IBM mainframes to this day are an evolution of the original S/360 and 
could still run software developed for the first models in the late 60s.

## Interesting Facts
- Used IBM's SLT circuits - a "hybrid" integrating circuit combining transistors on silicon wafers with separate discrete components (resistors/etc)
- Popularized the 8-bit byte.  Was the "atomic" unit of addressability in the S/360.  The term was brought over from the Stretch project
- Scalability was made possible by the use of a "control store" and microprogramming.  Also greatly enhanced the ability of S/360 to emulate earlier systems such as the 1401 and 7090.
- There was a lot of resistance from the GPD division (Endicott)
