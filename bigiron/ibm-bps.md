# IBM BPS - Basic Programming Support

## from Wikipedia:   
IBM Basic Programming Support/360 (BPS), originally called Special Support, was a set of standalone programs for System/360 mainframes
with a minimum of 8 KiB of memory.  

BPS was developed by IBM's General Products Division in Endicott, New York. The package included "assemblers, IOCS, compilers, sorts,
and utilities but no governing control program." BPS components were introduced in a series of product announcements between 1964 and
1965.

BPS came in two versions â€” a strictly card system and a tape based system which, contrary to the stated goals, kept a small supervisor
permanently resident.

Programming languages available were Assembler, RPG, and FORTRAN IV (subset). Tape FORTRAN required 16 KiB of memory.  There were also
two versions of the BPS assembler, with the tape version having enhanced capabilities.

BPS also had a "disk" counterpart called BOS. It also required 8 KiB of memory and supported disks such as the IBM 2311.

The group responsible for BPS/BOS went on to develop DOS/360 and TOS/360 as a supposed "interim" solution when it became evident that
OS/360 would be too large to run on 16 KiB systems.

## Other notes
Not sure when development of DOS/360 moved from Endicott.
