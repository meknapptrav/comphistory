# Lotus Improv
## Specs
- Developer: Lotus  
- Type: spreadsheet  
- Operating System: NeXTStep, Windows 3.0

## What it was  
A next-generation spreadsheet developed by Lotus that dramaticly changed typical spreadsheet conventions.  Data and formulas were separated.  Rows and columns could be named. 
Formulas ended up looking like ``Profit = Revenue - Cost`` rather than ``D2=B2-C2``.  Data was stored in an multi-dimensional database rather than forcing users to map it into a 
series of 2D sheets.  Creating different views of the data was very easy.

## Impact
Today's Pivot Tables are directly inspired by how Improv worked.  Also, Apple's Numbers app incorporates some of Improv's design philosophy.
